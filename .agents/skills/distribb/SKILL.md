## FIRST TIME READING THIS SKILL? STOP. WALK THE USER THROUGH THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.

The first time this skill loads in a conversation, do NOT jump straight to keyword research or writing. First walk the user through the points below, in this order, in your own words. This is the single most important habit: people who start with keyword research and publishing on day one get weak results and quit. People who follow the process get results.

### A. What Distribb is, in one breath

Distribb is your SEO platform. You (the AI agent) do the thinking and the writing. Distribb provides the infrastructure: real keyword data, a backlink exchange network of real businesses, Google Search Console analysis, CMS publishing (WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, Ghost, Wix, Notion, GoHighLevel, Framer, or any API webhook), a content calendar, social repurposing, and done-for-you distribution on the Accelerator plan. You bring your own AI model. Distribb does everything around the writing.

### B. The proper SEO process (show this list to the user every first run)

Tell the user this is the order that works, and that you will guide them through it:

1. **Create your account and go through onboarding** at https://distribb.io . Onboarding is where Distribb learns the business (website, language, tone, competitors, content pillars, publishing rules). Do not skip it. Tell the user: the quality of everything downstream depends on onboarding being complete and honest. See `references/onboarding-guide.md` for exactly what onboarding asks and why.
2. **Connect the two things that matter most: the website (CMS) and Google Search Console.** The CMS connection lets Distribb publish. The GSC connection lets you audit, avoid keywords they already rank for, and find real opportunities. Both are set up in onboarding (GSC is optional there and can also be added later in Settings). See `references/onboarding-guide.md` for the GSC connection details, including what to do if the user does not have Search Console set up yet.
3. **Make sure there is a blog to publish to.** Many sites have no blog or no blog index page. Without one, articles have nowhere to live. Confirm the site has a blog (or help them point Distribb at the right CMS collection) before writing anything.
4. **Audit the site BEFORE writing a single article.** This is step one of real SEO, not keyword research. The audit finds keyword cannibalization, content decay, pages stuck on page 2, missing topical clusters (topic cocoons), competitor gaps, and basic on-page problems. Run `/gsc-audit <domain>` or follow `references/audit-playbook.md`. The audit is available on every plan, including Free.
5. **Plan topical clusters, then do keyword research.** Group the work into topic clusters (a pillar page plus supporting articles that interlink) instead of random one-off posts. Then use keyword research to fill each cluster. See `references/audit-playbook.md` (topical authority section).
6. **Write and publish, always feeding the backlink exchange.** Every article should include 1-2 links to other businesses in the network so the user earns backlink credits. Distribb checks for this on submission and warns you if an article has none.
7. **Optimize what already ranks.** Use GSC-driven suggestions to rewrite pages stuck at the bottom of page 1 or on page 2. This is the fastest win because the page already has authority. Run `/optimize`.

This whole skill exists to run that loop for the user. When in doubt, point them back to it.

### C. The Backlink Exchange (explain this clearly, it is the differentiator)

Distribb runs a network of real businesses that exchange backlinks. When an article includes a link to another business in the network, Distribb detects it on submission and credits the user's project. The more links the user gives, the more they receive. These are real, high-DR (Domain Rating) backlinks from legitimate websites, not link farms. **Free plans receive 1 backlink per month. Paid plans get unlimited exchange access.** Backlinks are the hardest part of SEO to get right, and almost no other tool offers this. See `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`.

### D. Slash commands

This skill ships ready-to-use slash commands so the user can drive the whole workflow with `/`:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/distribb` | Overview, account status, and the proper SEO process above |
| `/distribb-setup` | Check the API key, confirm website + GSC are connected, and enable the other slash commands |
| `/gsc-audit <domain>` | Full SEO audit from Search Console + on-page + competitor + cannibalization + topic clusters |
| `/keyword-research <seed>` | Keyword ideas with volume and difficulty |
| `/write-article <keyword>` | Research, write, add internal links + backlinks, and publish one article |
| `/optimize` | Find and rewrite pages stuck on page 2+ using GSC data |
| `/backlinks` | Check backlink credits, see targets, and explain how the exchange works |
| `/content-calendar` | List, schedule, and manage planned/draft/published articles |
| `/ai-visibility` | Find where the user should be recommended by ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini and which listicles to pitch |
| `/news-writer <site-url-or-niche>` | Newsjack: find fresh news in the niche, write grounded news drafts, and queue them in Distribb |
| `/statistics-page-writer <topic>` | Deep-research and publish a sourced statistics page journalists cite for months |

If these commands are not yet available when the user types them, run `/distribb-setup` (or copy this skill's `commands/*.md` into the project's `.claude/commands/` folder) to register them. See the **Slash Commands** section below.

### E. Getting an account

If the user has no Distribb account yet, send them to **https://distribb.io** to sign up and go through onboarding. Their Distribb API key appears in Settings afterward. Plans at a glance (full detail in `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`):

- **Free Agentic** ($0/mo): bring your own DataForSEO or Ahrefs key for keyword research, 1 backlink/month, audit + calendar included.
- **Agentic Mode** ($49/mo, 3-day free trial): Distribb-provided keyword data, full backlink exchange.
- **Pro**: Distribb writes and publishes articles for you (the `POST /articles/generate` path), per-project credits.
- **Accelerator**: everything plus done-for-you distribution that places the business on the platforms AI engines cite most. See section below and `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`.

**Free Agentic plan, keyword research returns HTTP 402 until keys are saved:** On Free Agentic, `POST /keywords/search` returns `HTTP 402 Payment Required` with `error: "byo_keys_required"` until the user saves a DataForSEO or Ahrefs API key at https://distribb.io/settings#seo-keys. The 402 body includes an `instructions_for_agent` string. Surface it verbatim to the user, do not retry. See the **Keyword Research, BYO Keys** section below for the full contract.

## Setup

```bash
export DISTRIBB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

No installation required. All commands use `curl` and `jq`.

---

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **name** | distribb |
| **description** | SEO platform: keyword research, article writing, backlink exchange network, CMS publishing, social media repurposing, content calendar |
| **allowed-tools** | Bash(curl:*), Bash(jq:*), Bash(cat:*), WebFetch, WebSearch, Read, Write |

---

## API Base URL

All endpoints use: `https://distribb.io/api/v1`

All requests require the header: `Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY`

---

## Validate Your API Key

Before running any workflow, verify your API key works:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects | jq .
```

If you get `{"error": "Missing or invalid API key..."}` or `{"error": "Account is not active."}`, the key is wrong or the account is inactive. Ask the user to check their API key in Settings at https://distribb.io/settings.

---

## Start Here: Onboarding and the Two Connections

Before any keyword research or writing, the user must have completed onboarding at https://distribb.io and connected two things. Everything downstream depends on this.

**What onboarding collects** (so you know what Distribb already knows, and what to fill if it is thin): the website URL, then an AI pass that auto-populates business details. It captures language, tone (Informative / Conversational / Persuasive), writing profile (Experienced practitioner / Simple educational / Balanced SEO), product positioning, sitemap + blog root URL, content pillar URLs, internal-link count, keyword region, publishing time + timezone, blog publishing preference (publish live / save as draft in Distribb / send as draft to the CMS), image hosting + style, YouTube-videos toggle, brand intelligence, duplicate-content protection, custom AI instructions, 3-7 competitors, and the Google Search Console connection. Full field-by-field detail and how to read or change each via the API is in `references/onboarding-guide.md`.

**The two connections that matter most:**
1. **Website / CMS** (WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, Ghost, Wix, Notion, GoHighLevel, Framer, or API webhook). This is how Distribb publishes. Check it with `GET /integrations`.
2. **Google Search Console.** This powers the audit, keyword-gap detection, and optimization suggestions. Check it with `GET /search-console` (returns `connected: true/false`). If the user has GSC access but has not connected it to Distribb, send them to https://distribb.io/integrations . **If the user does not have Search Console set up at all yet**, point them to Google's guide first: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10267942?hl=en , then have them connect it in Distribb.

Also confirm the site actually has a **blog** to publish to. A site with no blog index has nowhere for articles to live, and this is a common reason new users see no results.

---

## The SEO Audit (Run This First, Even on Free)

Real SEO starts with an audit, not with publishing. Before writing anything for an existing site, run a full audit so the strategy is grounded in data. The audit is available on **every plan, including Free** (it only needs the website and, ideally, GSC).

A Distribb audit covers:
- **Keyword cannibalization** (multiple pages competing for the same query)
- **Content decay** (pages losing traffic vs the previous period)
- **Quick wins / striking distance** (queries at positions 11-20 and pages stuck on page 2+)
- **CTR optimization** (pages that rank but get fewer clicks than expected)
- **Dead pages** (pages that dropped to zero traffic)
- **Brand vs non-brand health**
- **Topical authority clusters (topic cocoons)** (which pillars and supporting clusters to build)
- **Competitor analysis** (gaps vs the competitors captured in onboarding)
- **Basic on-page checks** (titles, meta descriptions, headings, internal linking, indexability)

Run it with `/gsc-audit <domain>` or follow the full playbook in **`references/audit-playbook.md`**. The audit pulls real data from `GET /search-console`, `GET /suggestions`, and `GET /business-context`, crawls the live site for on-page checks, and ends with a prioritized action list wired to Distribb (new articles for gaps, optimization suggestions for page-2 pages). For very large GSC datasets, run each analysis in its own sub-agent so context stays manageable.

## Platform Tour: Where Things Live

Users often ask "where do I see X?" Here is the map (full detail in `references/platform-guide.md`):

| Page | What the user does there | API equivalent you can use |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Overview of projects and recent activity | `GET /projects` |
| **Content Calendar** | See and manage planned / draft / published articles and their schedule | `GET /articles`, `POST /articles`, `PUT /articles/:id`, `DELETE /articles/:id` |
| **Settings** | Business description, custom AI instructions, publish time, timezone, backlink-network toggle, SEO data keys | `GET /projects/:id`, `PUT /projects/:id` |
| **Integrations** | Connect CMS, social accounts, and Google Search Console | `GET /integrations`, `GET /search-console` |
| **Backlinks** | See backlinks earned and given, and credits | `GET /backlinks/status`, `GET /backlink-targets` |
| **Optimizations / Suggestions** | Review and approve GSC-driven rewrites of underperforming pages | `GET /suggestions`, `POST /suggestions/run`, approve/publish |

**Yes, you (the agent) can check backlinks for the user.** Use `GET /backlinks/status?project_id=...` for credits and counts, and `GET /backlink-targets` for who they can link to next. The dashboard Backlinks page shows the same data visually.

---

## Plans, Backlink Exchange, and the Accelerator

Quick reference (full detail in `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`):

- **Backlink exchange:** Free plans receive **1 backlink per month**. Paid plans get **unlimited** exchange access. Either way, the user only earns by giving, so always include 1-2 network links per article.
- **Accelerator (done-for-you visibility):** the top plan adds recurring done-for-you distribution that places the business on the third-party platforms AI engines cite most when recommending tools (high-authority Q&A answers, syndicated articles, and professional-network posts), plus done-for-you video. This is for users who want maximum AI-search visibility without doing the distribution themselves. When a user asks "how do I get recommended by ChatGPT/Perplexity without doing the work myself," the answer is the Accelerator plan plus the `/ai-visibility` workflow. Direct them to https://distribb.io to upgrade.

## Core Workflow

The full end-to-end process for creating a high-ranking SEO article:

```bash
# 1. DISCOVER: Get project info
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects | jq .

# 2. BUSINESS CONTEXT: Get brand voice, competitors, custom instructions
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/business-context?project_id=42" | jq .

# 3. KEYWORD RESEARCH: Find what to write about
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword": "crm software", "project_id": 42}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/keywords/search | jq .

# 4. INTERNAL LINKS: Get pages to cross-link in your article
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/internal-links?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .

# 5. BACKLINK TARGETS (REQUIRED if BecklinksNetworkParticipation is "Yes")
# This is how the user earns backlinks from real businesses. Do NOT skip this step.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/backlink-targets?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .

# 6. WRITE THE ARTICLE using your AI, weaving in internal links + backlink targets
# Output valid HTML. Follow the SEO writing guidelines below.
# You MUST include 1-2 URLs from the backlink-targets response as natural references.

# 7. SUBMIT: Save to Distribb's content calendar
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "best crm for small business",
    "title": "Best CRM for Small Business: 2026 Guide",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Your full HTML article here...</p>",
    "meta_description": "Compare the best CRM tools for small business in 2026.",
    "scheduled_date": "2026-04-01T09:00:00Z",

  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles | jq .

# 8. PUBLISH: Push to CMS (or let it auto-publish on schedule)
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123/publish | jq .
```

## Commands Reference

### List Projects

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects | jq .
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "ID": 42,
      "BusinessName": "Acme Corp",
      "WebsiteUrl": "https://acme.com",
      "BusinessDescription": "...",
      "Language": "English (US)",
      "Status": "Active",
      "BacklinkCredits": 10,
      "BecklinksNetworkParticipation": "Yes",
      "ArticlesPerDay": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Check the `BecklinksNetworkParticipation` field. If it is `"Yes"`, this project is part of the backlink exchange network. You MUST call `/backlink-targets` before writing each article and include 1-2 target URLs in the content. This is how the user earns backlinks from other real businesses. Skipping this means the user gives nothing and receives nothing from the network.

### Project Settings (Read & Edit) — the FULL settings surface

`GET` returns a `settings` object; `PUT` accepts that **same shape**. So the loop is: GET, change the keys you want, PUT them back (read-modify-write). The PUT exposes the *entire* Settings UI, ~30 fields, not just a handful, so you can configure a project end-to-end without the dashboard. This is what makes agency-scale onboarding possible.

```bash
# Read current settings  (returns { "project": {...}, "settings": {...} })
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/42 | jq .settings

# Edit settings (send ONLY the keys you want to change — partial updates are safe)
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sitemap_url": "https://acme.com/sitemap.xml",
    "blog_root_url": "https://acme.com/blog",
    "content_pillars": ["https://acme.com/crm", "https://acme.com/pricing"],
    "internal_links_per_article": 3,
    "tone": "Conversational",
    "writing_profile": "Balanced SEO",
    "product_positioning": "Soft mention",
    "image_hosting": "CMS",
    "brand_color": "#1d4ed8",
    "cta_intensity": "Soft",
    "competitors": ["https://competitor1.com", "https://competitor2.com"],
    "brand_intelligence": true,
    "duplicate_content_protection": true,
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/42 | jq .
```

**Writable fields** (every key the `settings` object returns is writable; aliases in parentheses):

| Field | Meaning / allowed values |
|-------|--------------------------|
| `ai_instructions` | Custom writing guidelines applied to every article. |
| `business_name`, `business_description` | Brand name + what the business does (writing context). |
| `target_audience` | List of audience strings, e.g. `["SaaS founders"]`. |
| `sitemap_url` | Sitemap URL (used to build the internal-link index). |
| `blog_root_url` | Blog root URL. |
| `content_pillars` | **List of URLs** (drives topic clusters + internal links). Each must be a valid URL, no spaces. |
| `internal_links_per_article` (`internal_links`) | Integer `1`–`5`. |
| `tone` | `Informative` \| `Conversational` \| `Persuasive`. |
| `language` | UI label or code, e.g. `English (US)`, `French`, `en-gb`. |
| `keyword_region` | e.g. `United States`, `United Kingdom`, `Worldwide`. |
| `writing_profile` | `Experienced practitioner` \| `Simple educational` \| `Balanced SEO`. |
| `product_positioning` | `Neutral operational` \| `Soft mention` \| `Promotional`. |
| `custom_author_name` | Byline author name. |
| `social_media_ai_instructions` | Custom instructions for repurposed social posts. |
| `publish_time` | Daily auto-publish time, 24-hour `"HH:MM"`. |
| `timezone` | IANA name, e.g. `"Europe/Madrid"`. |
| `publishing_status` | `Publish Immediately` \| `Save as Drafts` \| `Send as Drafts`. |
| `social_media_publishing_status` | `Save as Drafts` \| `Publish Immediately`. |
| `image_hosting` | `Distribb` \| `CMS`. |
| `image_style` | Free text (e.g. `Realism`, or a custom description). |
| `brand_color` | Hex string like `"#e11d2a"`. |
| `image_prompt_instructions` | Extra guidance for image generation. |
| `title_based_featured_image` | `true`/`false`, title-card featured image. |
| `cta_intensity` | `None` \| `Soft` \| `Direct`. |
| `first_person_writing` | `true`/`false`. |
| `table_of_contents` | `true`/`false`, auto table of contents. |
| `avoid_formulaic_section_endings` | `true`/`false`. |
| `require_operational_examples` | `true`/`false`. |
| `strict_banned_phrase_guard` | `true`/`false`. |
| `banned_phrases` (`extra_banned_phrases`) | List of phrases to never use. |
| `brand_intelligence` | `true`/`false`. |
| `duplicate_content_protection` (`duplicate_content_guard_enabled`) | `true`/`false`. |
| `videos_enabled` | `true`/`false`. |
| `backlinks_network` | `true`/`false`, join/leave the backlink exchange. |
| `competitors` (`competitor_websites`) | **List of competitor domains** (read AND write). |

**Partial updates are safe.** The article-quality and image preferences are stored as merged JSON, so sending just `{"cta_intensity": "Soft"}` changes ONLY that, the other quality flags keep their current values. Invalid enum values return `400` with a message naming the allowed values.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "project_id": 42,
  "updated_fields": ["tone", "cta_intensity", "competitors"],
  "updated_columns": ["ContentStyle", "ArticleQualitySettings", "CompetitorWebsites"],
  "message": "Project settings updated."
}
```

**Not settable via API:**
- `articles_per_day` — plan-controlled. If sent, it's echoed back under `ignored`. Read it via `GET /api/v1/projects` or the `settings` block.
- **Optimization thresholds** (`min_position`, `max_position`, `min_impressions_per_week`, `min_article_age_days`, `excluded_article_ids`) — applied at scan time by `POST /api/v1/suggestions/run`, not yet persisted per project. Sent values are echoed under `ignored`.

### Create a Project (agency-scale onboarding)

Spin up a brand-new project for a client and configure it in ONE call. You can pass any writable settings field from the table above alongside the basics.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "website_url": "https://client.com",
    "business_name": "Client Co",
    "business_description": "Bookkeeping for trades businesses.",
    "target_audience": ["plumbers", "electricians"],
    "tone": "Conversational",
    "content_pillars": ["https://client.com/bookkeeping", "https://client.com/payroll"],
    "competitors": ["https://rival.com"]
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects | jq .
```

**Response (201):** `{ "project_id": 77, "project_slots": {"used": 3, "total": 5}, "next_step": "...", ... }`

**Project slots are gated by the paid quantity.** If the account is already at its limit, you get **HTTP 402**:
```json
{
  "error": "project_limit_reached",
  "active_projects": 5,
  "project_quantity": 5,
  "purchase_url": "https://distribb.io/dashboard?add_project=1",
  "instructions_for_agent": "Tell the user they've hit their project limit and share purchase_url ..."
}
```
When you see this: **show the user `purchase_url`** (one click opens the "Buy More Seats" dialog in their dashboard). Once they confirm they bought a slot, **retry the same POST**. Never try to bypass the limit.

Creating a project **does NOT start keyword research** (that spends credits). After it's created, **ASK the user** whether they want to kick off keyword research + the first articles now. If yes, call the onboarding endpoint below.

### Run Onboarding (keyword research + first articles)

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/77/onboarding | jq .
```

Starts the same pipeline the dashboard runs when onboarding finishes: GSC-aware keyword discovery -> a planned content calendar -> the first articles begin generating. Returns **202**; poll `GET /api/v1/articles?project_id=77` to watch planned articles appear.

- **Always ask the user first** — this spends keyword/LLM credits.
- If the project already has articles, it returns `already_onboarded` and does nothing.
- On Free / Agentic plans this returns `skipped_byok` (those plans bring their own keywords — use `POST /api/v1/keywords/search` then `POST /api/v1/articles`).

### Connect WordPress

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "wordpress_url": "https://client.com", "integration_key": "<plugin Integration Key>" }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/77/wordpress | jq .
```

Install the Distribb WordPress plugin on the site, copy its **Integration Key**, and send it here. Credentials are validated (format check + live probe) before saving, the same checks the dashboard runs. Returns `{ "status": "connected" }`; if live validation is inconclusive (WAF/network) it still saves and returns a `warning`.

### Business Context

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/business-context?project_id=42" | jq .
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "business_name": "Acme Corp",
  "website_url": "https://acme.com",
  "description": "CRM platform for startups...",
  "competitors": ["https://competitor1.com", "https://competitor2.com"],
  "ai_instructions": "Use a friendly tone, focus on SaaS...",
  "language": "English (US)",
  "target_audience": "SaaS founders, startup CTOs",
  "internal_links_per_article": 5
}
```

Use this before writing. The `competitors` list tells you which domains to NEVER link to. The `ai_instructions` field has custom writing guidelines from the user.

### Keyword Research

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword": "project management", "project_id": 42}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/keywords/search | jq .
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "keywords": [
    {
      "keyword": "best project management tools",
      "search_volume": 12000,
      "keyword_difficulty": 35
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns the seed keyword plus up to 20 related keywords with volume and difficulty.

#### BYO Keys, Free Agentic plan

If the calling user is on the **Free Agentic** plan and has not yet saved a DataForSEO or Ahrefs API key, this endpoint returns **HTTP 402 Payment Required** with a structured body so your agent knows exactly what to do. Paid plans (Agentic Mode and above) never see this response.

**Response (402 Payment Required):**
```json
{
  "error": "byo_keys_required",
  "message": "Keyword research requires your own DataForSEO or Ahrefs API key.",
  "plan": "Agentic Free",
  "required": { "any_of": ["dataforseo", "ahrefs"] },
  "setup_url": "https://distribb.io/settings#seo-keys",
  "docs_url": "https://distribb.io/api-docs#byo-keys",
  "instructions_for_agent": "Tell the user to add their DataForSEO Login + API Key (or Ahrefs API Key) at distribb.io/settings, then re-run keyword research."
}
```

**Agent contract, what to do when you see this 402:**

1. **Halt** the keyword-research step. Do not retry automatically.
2. **Surface** the `instructions_for_agent` string verbatim to the human user.
3. **Link** the user to `setup_url` (Distribb Settings → SEO Data API Keys).
4. **Resume** keyword research only after the user confirms they've saved keys.

Pseudocode:

```python
resp = call_distribb("/api/v1/keywords/search", body)
if resp.status_code == 402 and resp.json().get("error") == "byo_keys_required":
    instructions = resp.json()["instructions_for_agent"]
    setup_url    = resp.json()["setup_url"]
    say_to_user(f"{instructions} Setup link: {setup_url}")
    return  # do not retry; wait for user
```

If the user has saved only an Ahrefs key (not DataForSEO), the response is sourced from Ahrefs Keywords Explorer and includes `"source": "byo_ahrefs"` plus a `note` field. All other endpoints in this skill (articles, integrations, backlinks, internal links) work normally for Free Agentic users without any BYO keys.

### Internal Links

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/internal-links?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "links": [
    {
      "url": "https://acme.com/blog/crm-guide",
      "title": "The Complete CRM Guide",
      "keyword": "crm guide",
      "meta_description": "Everything you need..."
    }
  ],
  "num_links_recommended": 5,
  "website_url": "https://acme.com"
}
```

Include the recommended number of internal links in each article. Place them naturally in the middle of paragraphs using `<a href="EXACT_URL">descriptive anchor text</a>`. Never use "click here". Space links at least 2 paragraphs apart.

### Backlink Exchange

```bash
# Get backlink targets to include in your article
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/backlink-targets?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .

# Check credits and status
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/backlinks/status?project_id=42" | jq .
```

**Targets response:**
```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "url": "https://partner-site.com/related-article",
      "title": "Related Partner Article",
      "meta_description": "...",
      "project_name": "Partner Co"
    }
  ],
  "category": "saas",
  "credits": 10,
  "instructions": "Include 1-2 of these URLs as natural references..."
}
```

**How the backlink exchange works:**
Distribb connects real businesses that exchange backlinks with each other. When you include a link to a network partner in your article, Distribb detects it on submission and credits the user's project. The more backlinks the user gives out, the more they receive in return. These are high-quality, high-DR backlinks from real business websites.

The `category` field shows how the keyword was classified (e.g. "saas", "ecommerce"). Targets are capped at 5 per request. Include 1-2 backlink targets per article as natural references. Do NOT fabricate information about linked sites. Use topically relevant anchor text.

### Generate Article (Pro plan only)

If the user wants Distribb to write the article from their source content (notes, drafts, talking points), use this endpoint. Distribb's AI will expand it into a full SEO article with YouTube videos, images, quotes, backlinks, and internal links. Costs 1 article credit. Not available on the Agentic plan.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "link building strategies",
    "source_content": "Link building is about getting other websites to link to yours. Three main approaches: guest posting, broken link building, and creating linkable assets like original research...",
    "instructions": "Add YouTube videos, include data and statistics",
    "article_style": "Informative"
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/generate | jq .
```

**Response (202):**
```json
{
  "article_id": 456,
  "status": "generating",
  "keyword": "link building strategies",
  "slug": "link-building-strategies",
  "message": "Article generation started...",
  "article_credits_remaining": 29
}
```

The article takes a few minutes to generate. Poll `GET /api/v1/articles/456` to check when `Status` changes from `Planned` to `Draft` or `Published`.

### Create Article

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "best crm tools for startups",
    "title": "10 Best CRM Tools for Startups in 2026",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Finding the right CRM...</p>",
    "meta_description": "Compare the 10 best CRM tools for startups.",
    "scheduled_date": "2026-04-01T09:00:00Z",
    "status": "Planned"
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles | jq .
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "article_id": 123,
  "status": "Planned",
  "keyword": "best crm tools for startups",
  "slug": "best-crm-tools-for-startups",
  "message": "Article created as Planned.",
  "backlinks_processed": 2
}
```

**If the article contained NO network backlinks, the response includes a warning:**
```json
{
  "article_id": 124,
  "status": "Draft",
  "keyword": "crm for freelancers",
  "slug": "crm-for-freelancers",
  "message": "Article created as Draft.",
  "backlinks_processed": 0,
  "backlinks_warning": "Your project participates in the backlinks network but this article contains no backlinks to other network members. Include backlink targets (from GET /api/v1/backlink-targets) to earn credits and keep receiving backlinks."
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** If `backlinks_warning` is present in the response:
1. Call `GET /backlink-targets` to fetch network URLs for the article's keyword.
2. Revise the article content to naturally include 1-2 of those URLs.
3. Call `PUT /api/v1/articles/{article_id}` with the revised content.
4. If the user has disabled automatic revision, inform them: "This article doesn't include any backlinks to the exchange network. You won't earn backlink credits for it, which means fewer backlinks from other businesses."

For long articles, write the HTML to a file and use `@` syntax:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg content "$(cat article.html)" '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "best crm tools",
    "title": "10 Best CRM Tools",
    "content": $content,
    "status": "Draft"
  }')" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles | jq .
```

Setting a `scheduled_date` schedules the article: submit it as a `Draft` with a date and Distribb auto-promotes it to `Planned` (passing `status: Planned` yourself is still fine). Omit the date and it stays a `Draft` for review. What happens ON the date depends on the project's `PublishingStatus` (read it from `GET /api/v1/projects`): `Publish Immediately` goes live; `Save as Drafts` keeps it as a draft inside Distribb for manual review; `Send as Drafts` pushes it to the CMS as a draft. So a correctly-scheduled article on a `Save as Drafts` project will NOT auto-publish to the live site, that is by design, not a bug.

### Update Article

Use this to revise an article after submission, for example to add backlink targets if the creation response included a `backlinks_warning`.

```bash
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg content "$(cat revised-article.html)" '{
    "content": $content
  }')" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .
```

**Updatable fields:** `title`, `content`, `meta_description`, `keyword`, `article_style`, `status` (Draft or Planned), `scheduled_date`. Send only the fields you want to change. Changing `keyword` also regenerates the article's slug. Scheduling is symmetric: sending a `scheduled_date` on a `Draft` promotes it to `Planned` (so it actually enters the publish pipeline), and sending `"scheduled_date": null` **unschedules** it, dropping a `Planned` article back to `Draft`. Pass an explicit `status` if you want to override either default.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "article_id": 123,
  "updated_fields": ["Content", "IsPreGenerated"],
  "message": "Article updated successfully.",
  "backlinks_processed": 2
}
```

If content is updated and the project participates in the backlink network, Distribb re-scans for network backlinks and updates credits. You cannot update published articles.

### Delete Article

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .
```

Deletes a `Draft` or `Planned` article. **Published articles cannot be deleted** (the live CMS post would be orphaned), you get a `400`. Unpublish or hide it from the dashboard/CMS first, or simply unschedule it.

**Response (200):**
```json
{ "article_id": 123, "deleted": true, "message": "Article deleted." }
```

To take an article off the calendar *without* deleting it, **unschedule** instead: `PUT /api/v1/articles/123` with body `{"scheduled_date": null}`.

### List Articles

```bash
# All articles for a project (default: 50 per page)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles?project_id=42" | jq .

# Filter by status
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles?project_id=42&status=Published" | jq .

# Pagination: use limit (max 200) and offset
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles?project_id=42&limit=20&offset=40" | jq .
```

**Query parameters:** `project_id` (optional), `status` (optional: Draft, Planned, Published), `limit` (default 50, max 200), `offset` (default 0).

### Get Single Article

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .
```

### Publish Article

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123/publish | jq .
```

Pushes the article to the user's connected CMS (WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, etc.). A manual publish like this **always goes live**, even if the project is set to `Save as Drafts` / `Send as Drafts`, that preference only controls AUTOMATIC scheduled publishing, not a deliberate "publish now". Returns `200` with `{"status":"published","url":...}` once the CMS confirms a live URL; `202` with `{"status":"pending"}` if the CMS hasn't confirmed yet (it will retry, the article is NOT lost).

**The project must have a website/CMS connected.** If none is, this returns **`400` with `{"error":"no_cms_integration"}`** and a `connect_url`. Surface that to the user verbatim, there is nowhere to publish until they connect their site at https://distribb.io/integrations . This is the single most common reason a scheduled article never publishes: a Google Search Console (analytics) connection is NOT a publishing destination. Before you tell a user an article will publish, confirm a CMS is connected with `GET /api/v1/integrations`.

### Social Media Repurposing (Automatic)

When an article is published to the user's CMS, Distribb automatically generates social media posts for every platform the user has connected (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, etc.). The agent does not need to call any endpoint for this. It happens server-side.

The social posts are created as drafts in the user's content calendar so they can review, edit, or schedule them from the Distribb dashboard. If the user has connected social accounts, publishing an article through the API triggers this automatically.

### List Integrations

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/integrations?project_id=42" | jq .
```

### Google Search Console

Pull the user's **real** search performance from Google Search Console, top queries, top pages, and site totals (clicks, impressions, CTR, average position). Use it to find queries worth targeting, pages sitting just off page 1, or terms the user already ranks for. **Requires the user to have connected GSC.**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/search-console?project_id=42&days=28&limit=25" | jq .
```

**Query parameters:** `project_id` (required), `days` (default 28, max 90), `limit` (rows per list, default 25, max 100).

**Response (200, connected):**
```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "project_id": 42,
  "property": "sc-domain:acme.com",
  "date_range": { "start_date": "2026-05-06", "end_date": "2026-06-03", "days": 28 },
  "totals": { "clicks": 1840, "impressions": 92344, "ctr": 0.0199, "avg_position": 18.4 },
  "top_queries": [
    { "query": "best crm for small business", "clicks": 210, "impressions": 8100, "ctr": 0.0259, "position": 7.2 }
  ],
  "top_pages": [
    { "page": "https://acme.com/blog/crm-guide", "clicks": 320, "impressions": 14200, "ctr": 0.0225, "position": 9.1 }
  ]
}
```

**Response (200, NOT connected):**
```json
{
  "connected": false,
  "message": "Google Search Console is not connected for this project.",
  "instructions_for_agent": "Tell the user to connect Google Search Console at https://distribb.io/integrations ...",
  "connect_url": "https://distribb.io/integrations"
}
```

**Agent contract:**
- If `connected` is `false`, **stop and tell the user the `instructions_for_agent` text verbatim**, link them to `connect_url` (https://distribb.io/integrations), and do not retry until they confirm they've connected GSC.
- If `connected` is `true` but the body has `"error": "gsc_fetch_failed"`, their Google token likely expired, tell them to reconnect at the same URL.

**How to use the data:** queries with lots of impressions but low CTR or an average position of ~8-20 are the best targets, write a new article or refresh an existing one for them. Pages at the bottom of page 1 (position ~8-12) often just need internal links and a content refresh to climb. Pair this with `POST /articles` (write the piece) and `GET /internal-links` (cross-link it).

### Content Optimizations (Suggestions)

Distribb continuously finds pages where a rewrite could win more traffic, mostly from the user's **Google Search Console** data (queries with impressions but low CTR, pages stuck at the bottom of page 1). Each one is a **suggestion**: Distribb scrapes the live page, has its AI draft an improved version, and stages a before/after **diff** for review. You (the agent) list them, inspect the diff, approve (which triggers the rewrite), then publish the approved rewrite straight to the user's CMS. This is the highest-leverage ongoing SEO loop, it acts on pages that *already* rank, so wins come faster than net-new articles.

**Lifecycle:** `pending` → (approve) → `rewriting` → `ready` → (publish) → `published`. A suggestion can also be `rejected`, `failed`, or `superseded` (the article changed after the suggestion was created, so the staged rewrite is stale).

```bash
# Generate a fresh batch now (pulls GSC + scores articles). Mirrors the weekly cron.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": 42}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions/run | jq .

# List suggestions (optionally filter by status: pending, ready, published, ...)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions?project_id=42&status=pending" | jq .

# Inspect a single suggestion, then its before/after rewrite
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions/123 | jq .
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions/123/diff | jq .

# Approve -> starts a background rewrite. Poll the suggestion until status is "ready".
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions/123/approve | jq .

# Once "ready", publish the rewrite to the connected CMS
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions/123/publish | jq .

# Not happy with the rewrite? Regenerate with feedback (only valid while "ready")
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"feedback": "Keep the pricing table, tighten the intro, add a FAQ."}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions/123/regenerate | jq .

# Or dismiss it
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Page is being deprecated."}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/suggestions/123/reject | jq .
```

**List response (200):**
```json
{
  "project_id": 42,
  "gsc_connected": true,
  "counts": { "pending": 4, "ready": 1, "published": 9, "rejected": 2 },
  "settings": { "enabled": true },
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "project_id": 42,
      "article_id": 8801,
      "status": "pending",
      "suggestion_type": "content_rewrite",
      "source_type": "distribb",
      "article_title": "Best CRM for Small Business",
      "article_url": "https://acme.com/blog/crm-guide",
      "trigger_snapshot": { "query": "best crm for small business", "impressions": 8100, "ctr": 0.012, "position": 11.4 },
      "created_at": "2026-06-16T06:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Agent contract:**
- **Approve and publish are real, billable actions.** `publish` pushes the rewrite live to the user's CMS. Show the user the diff (`GET /suggestions/:id/diff`) and get a clear go-ahead before approving/publishing, unless they've explicitly told you to run optimizations autonomously.
- **Approve and regenerate are asynchronous.** They return immediately with status `rewriting`. Poll `GET /api/v1/suggestions/:id` every ~15-30s until status is `ready` (rewrite staged) or `failed`. Do **not** publish until `ready`.
- **A `409` on approve or publish is a conflict**, the article changed since the suggestion was created (status flips to `superseded`). Run `POST /suggestions/run` to regenerate fresh suggestions against the current article, then start over.
- If `gsc_connected` is `false` and the list is empty, follow the `instructions_for_agent` string: tell the user to connect GSC at https://distribb.io/integrations, then `POST /suggestions/run`.

**Parameters:**
- `GET /suggestions`, `project_id` (required), `status` (optional), `limit` (default 100, max 500).
- `POST /suggestions/run`, `project_id` (required).
- `POST /suggestions/:id/reject`, optional `reason`. `POST /suggestions/:id/regenerate`, optional `feedback`.

### Microworkers Campaign Management

Use these endpoints to manage Microworkers Basic Campaigns through Distribb. Campaigns are project-scoped, so always pass `project_id` when creating or registering a campaign. Only rate a worker slot `OK` after the submitted proof has been verified.

```bash
# List registered campaigns
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/microworkers/campaigns?project_id=42" | jq .

# Create a campaign with a Microworkers template
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg template_html "$(cat microworkers-template.html)" '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "title": "Post a Reddit Comment",
    "description": "Follow the Distribb task page, post the exact comment, and submit the comment URL plus confirmation code.",

# Register an existing campaign created by a VPS script
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": 42, "campaign_id": "123456", "platform": "reddit", "campaign_type": "reddit_comment"}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/microworkers/campaigns/register | jq .

# Get live campaign details
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/microworkers/campaigns/123456 | jq .

# List submitted slots that need rating
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/microworkers/campaigns/123456/slots?status=NOTRATED&pageSize=50" | jq .

# Rate a slot after proof verification
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"campaign_id": "123456", "rating": "OK", "comment": "Proof verified. Thank you."}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/microworkers/slots/7890/rate | jq .
```

**Create campaign request fields:** `project_id`, `title`, `description`, and `template_html` are required. Optional fields: `platform`, `campaign_type`, `category_id`, `available_positions`, `payment_per_task` (minimum `0.15`), `minutes_to_finish`, `ttr`, `speed`, `template_title`, `number_of_file_proofs`, and `allowed_file_types`.

**Rating rules:** `rating` must be `OK`, `NOK`, or `REVISE`. Use `NOK` with a clear worker-facing `comment` when proof is invalid. Use `REVISE` when the worker can fix the submission.

## SEO Article Writing System

Follow this for EVERY article. The goal: content a human wants to read AND that AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews) quote and recommend.

### 1. Format first
Pick the format from search intent, then follow its spine:
- **Listicle** ("best X", "top X", "X tools/agencies/alternatives") -> short intro -> `## 1. [Named option]` ... `## N. [Named option]` -> optional ONE "how to choose" checklist near the end -> FAQ -> short conclusion
- **Comparison** ("X vs Y") -> short intro -> quick context -> one section per option on the SAME criteria -> verdict -> FAQ
- **Review** -> short intro -> one section per aspect (features, pricing reality, support) -> verdict -> FAQ
- **How-to** ("how to X", literal procedures) -> short intro -> `## Step 1: [Action]` ... (sequential) -> FAQ -> conclusion
- **Explainer** ("what is X") -> short intro that answers the question in 2 sentences -> definition -> how it works -> pitfalls -> FAQ
- **Resources** ("X templates/examples/statistics") -> short intro -> the curated collection -> FAQ

The worst mistake is writing a "best X" listicle as a how-to ("Step 1: define your goals"). Name the actual options. That IS the article.

### 2. Go straight to the point
- Intro is SHORT: 2-4 sentences, under ~80 words. A hook, one line of stakes, then straight to the payoff.
- In a listicle/comparison/review, NEVER add a "Why X matters", "What is X", or "Benefits of X" preamble section. Fold a one-line definition into the intro at most, then go straight to the items.
- Never start a section with "In today's...", "When it comes to...", or "Whether you're X or Y."

### 3. Section anatomy
- **Listicle item** (`## N. [Name]`): one line of what it is (plain "is/has") -> who it's best for -> 2-4 sentences of concrete, sourced reasons it earns the spot -> an honest caveat/limitation -> vary the closer (don't end every item with "Bottom line:").
- **How-to step** (`## Step N: [Action]`): goal -> exact imperative instructions -> a milestone ("By now you should have...").
- **FAQ** (last before conclusion): 4-6 questions as people actually type them; 40-80 word answers; direct answer in the FIRST sentence (that's what AI engines lift).
- **Conclusion**: short -- one recommendation + one next action. No keyword-stuffed recap.

### 4. Humanize before you ship
Write the draft, cut these AI tells, then ask "what still reads like AI?" and fix it:
- Significance inflation ("a testament to", "plays a pivotal role", "stands as"); promotional fluff ("vibrant", "robust", "seamless", "boasts"); vague attribution ("experts believe" with no source).
- "-ing" tails that fake depth ("..., highlighting its value"); "not just X, it's Y"; forced rule-of-three; "from X to Y" false ranges; synonym cycling (one term, repeated).
- Signposting ("Let's dive in"); persuasive-authority tropes ("at its core", "the real question is"); fake-candor openers ("Honestly?", "Here's the thing").
- Filler ("in order to"->"to", "due to the fact that"->"because"); "**Label:** description" inline-header lists; em dashes; emojis; curly quotes.
- Use plain verbs (is/has, not serves as/boasts). Vary sentence length hard. Take a clear stance. Never bold the keyword.

### 5. Length: match the top results, then build on top (NOT shortness for its own sake)
- Decide length dynamically from the TOP 3 ranking pages for the keyword: check how long they are, match that depth, then build a little on top (skyscraper). They rank for a reason -- emulate them, then go a bit beyond. Cap it around 3,000 words; never runaway-pad.
- Reach that length with REAL substance: examples, sourced facts, specifics, genuine depth per section. Never filler or padding. Don't pad past the depth the topic needs, and DON'T undershoot it by writing thin.
- Structure stays tight even when the article is long: the DEPTH lives in the body sections, not a bloated intro.
- (Some founders prefer short, punchy articles. If the project's `ai_instructions` ask for that, follow them.)

### 6. SEO + AI-recommendation mechanics
- Primary keyword in the first ~100 words once (never bolded), then naturally where it fits. Don't repeat the exact phrase in every heading or stuff a stale year everywhere.
- Write quotable, self-contained claims AI engines lift as answers: "X reduces Y by Z%, according to [source]" beats "X has many benefits."
- Cite 2-3 real authority sources (primary sources, official docs, .gov/.edu, Wikipedia) -- never a competitor's blog ranking for the same keyword.
- Use H2 for sections, H3 for subsections. Output valid HTML, not markdown.

### Internal Linking
- Use the exact URLs from the `/internal-links` response.
- Place links in the middle of substantive paragraphs, never in intros or conclusions.
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here" or "read more").
- Space links at least 2 paragraphs apart.
- Format: `<a href="https://site.com/exact-url">descriptive anchor text</a>`

### Backlink Exchange (Critical for SEO growth)
- ALWAYS call `GET /backlink-targets` before writing if the project has `BecklinksNetworkParticipation: "Yes"`.
- Include 1-2 URLs from the response as natural references in the body of your article.
- Do NOT fabricate information about linked sites. Read the `title` and `meta_description` to understand what the page covers and reference it honestly.
- Use topically relevant anchor text (not "click here" or the raw URL).
- Distribb scans the HTML on submission and automatically credits the user's project (+1 credit per backlink given). More credits = more backlinks received from the network.
- If you submit an article without network backlinks, the API returns a `backlinks_warning`. Inform the user.

### Competitor Protection
- Check competitors from `/business-context`.
- Never link to competitor websites.
- You may mention competitors factually but without outbound links.

## Workflow: AI Search Visibility & Listicle Backlink Outreach

Use this workflow when the user asks you to:
- "Find places where Distribb should be recommended by ChatGPT / Perplexity / Gemini / Claude / Google AI Overviews"
- "Find listicles / round-ups / 'best tools' articles I should pitch to get Distribb added"
- "Audit my AI search visibility" / "find AI SEO mentions"
- "Build me a backlink outreach list for AI search"
- Any variant of "where should I get mentioned so AI search recommends my product"

This is a **3-phase research playbook**. You (the agent) act as an **AI search visibility strategist**. The deliverable is actionable enough for a VA or outreach person to execute without re-asking the user any questions.

If the user is running this workflow for a project other than their own Distribb business, swap "Distribb" for the target project's business name and competitors from `GET /business-context?project_id=...`. Otherwise default to Distribb.io itself (a SaaS that does AI SEO keyword research, content writing/publishing, a backlink exchange network, social repurposing, and AI-search visibility).

### Phase 1: Identify buyer prompts

Generate **at least 100 realistic prompts** that a potential Distribb buyer would type into ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, or Google AI Overviews, prompts where Distribb *should* be recommended.

Cover all of these prompt categories (≥10 per category):

1. **"Best tools"**, e.g. "What are the best AI SEO tools for agencies?"
2. **"Alternatives"**, e.g. "Best alternatives to Surfer SEO for automated content"
3. **"Comparison"**, e.g. "Outranking vs Surfer SEO vs automated SEO tools"
4. **"Problem-solving"**, e.g. "How do I automate SEO content and backlinks for my agency?"
5. **"Agency-specific"**, e.g. "Best white-label SEO automation software for agencies"
6. **"AI visibility / GEO"**, e.g. "How do I get my business recommended by ChatGPT?"
7. **"Backlink automation"**, e.g. "Best tools to get backlinks without manual outreach"
8. **"Content automation"**, e.g. "Best AI tools to write and publish SEO articles automatically"

Bias toward **buying intent**, **comparison intent**, and **problem-aware intent**. Skip pure informational queries ("what is SEO").

For **every** prompt, capture these columns:

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| Prompt | The exact phrasing a buyer would type |
| Search intent | Informational / Comparison / Transactional |
| Buyer stage | Problem-aware / Solution-aware / Ready-to-buy |
| Ideal Distribb angle | The single sentence positioning that should land in the AI answer |
| Main competitors likely to appear | Surfer, Jasper, Frase, MarketMuse, Clearscope, Scalenut, Outranking, SE Ranking, Semrush, Ahrefs, KoalaWriter, NeuronWriter, Copy.ai, Writesonic, etc. |
| Priority | 1-10 (10 = closest to ready-to-buy + highest commercial value) |
| Why this prompt matters | One-line rationale |

### Phase 2: Run and analyze the top 30 prompts

Take the **30 highest-priority prompts** from Phase 1 and actually run them. Use `WebSearch` and/or `WebFetch` against live AI-search-shaped queries, do not guess. For each, capture:

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| Prompt | From Phase 1 |
| Distribb appears? | Yes / No / Partial (e.g. mentioned but not recommended) |
| Competitors that appear | List the actual names in the live answer |
| Sources cited / referenced | URLs that the AI/SERP is citing, listicles, blogs, Reddit, YouTube, G2/Capterra, Product Hunt, company pages |
| Article(s) most influencing the answer | The 1-3 URLs doing the heavy lifting |
| Source type mix | SaaS review site / blog listicle / Reddit / YouTube / company page / forum / news |
| What Distribb needs to be included or rank higher | Concrete gap: missing from listicle X, no Reddit mention, no comparison page, no G2 profile, etc. |

**Hard rules for Phase 2:**
- **Do not fabricate URLs, rankings, or citations.** If a prompt can't be run or a source can't be verified, write `unverified` in the cell and explain why in a footnote.
- Cite source URLs in full.
- If a result is from a cache and may be stale, say so.

### Phase 3: Third-party listicles to target for outreach

For every Phase 2 prompt where **Distribb should appear but does not**, find the third-party pages already being cited or ranking. **Prioritize listicles, round-ups, comparison posts, and directories** over competitor homepages. Page archetypes to hunt for:

- "Best AI SEO tools" / "Best AI SEO software"
- "Best SEO automation tools"
- "Best AI writing tools for SEO"
- "Best [Competitor] alternatives" (Surfer, Jasper, Frase, MarketMuse, Clearscope, Scalenut, Outranking, KoalaWriter, NeuronWriter, etc.)
- "Best SEO tools for agencies" / "white-label SEO software"
- "Best backlink tools" / "Best link-building software"
- "Best content marketing automation tools"
- "Best tools to rank in AI search" / "GEO tools" / "tools to get mentioned by ChatGPT"
- "Best programmatic SEO tools"
- "Best SEO tools for startups"

For each target page, capture:

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| Article title | Exact title |
| URL | Full URL |
| Website / domain | Root domain |
| Article category | One of the archetypes above |
| Why it matters | Which AI answer or SERP it currently shapes |
| Prompt(s) it could influence | Reference Phase 1 prompt numbers |
| Current tools mentioned | The 5-15 tools already in the listicle |
| Distribb currently included? | Yes / No / Briefly mentioned |
| Outreach priority | High / Medium / Low |
| Suggested pitch angle | One specific reason to add Distribb (e.g. "you cover Surfer + Frase but no tool in your list does the backlink exchange piece") |
| Contact info | Contact page URL, author name, author email, or the "submit a tool" form URL, verified, not invented |
| Personalization notes | Recent post by the author, the year of the listicle, the angle of their site, anything a VA can use in the first line |

### Required output (in this exact order)

1. **Table 1, Top 100 prompts** (Phase 1, all columns).
2. **Table 2, Top 30 prompt tests** (Phase 2, all columns, with live source URLs).
3. **Table 3, Third-party listicles & sites to reach out to** (Phase 3, all columns).
4. **Top 10 outreach opportunities**, ranked by *easiest win x highest impact*. For each: target URL, why it's the easiest win (e.g. author already updates the post yearly, accepts tool submissions, already mentions a Distribb-adjacent tool), and the suggested first-line of the pitch.

### Operating rules (read before starting)

- **Prioritize listicles and third-party articles, not competitor homepages.** A pitch to "add Distribb to your round-up" is far easier than dislodging a competitor's own site.
- **Prioritize pages that already mention** Surfer SEO, Jasper, Copy.ai, Writesonic, Frase, MarketMuse, Clearscope, Scalenut, Outranking, SE Ranking, Semrush, Ahrefs, KoalaWriter, NeuronWriter, and similar, those authors have already decided this category is worth covering.
- **Do not fabricate** URLs, rankings, citations, author emails, or DR/traffic numbers. If you can't verify, say `unverified` and explain.
- **Think like a buyer, not like a keyword tool.** A keyword-volume prompt ("seo software") is less valuable than a buying-intent prompt ("best seo tool that also does backlinks for an agency").
- **Focus on prompts where someone is close to buying software or hiring a solution.**
- The final output should be **handover-ready** for a VA or outreach person, every row should be independently actionable.
- This workflow is **research + strategy**, not publishing. Do **not** call any Distribb article-creation endpoints (`POST /articles`, `POST /articles/generate`, etc.) during this workflow. Output the tables to the user; let them decide what to do next (pitch the listicles manually, or feed them into a separate outreach workflow).

### Tools to use

- `WebSearch` for finding listicles and running buyer-intent queries.
- `WebFetch` for reading the actual content of each candidate listicle (to confirm tools mentioned, find author/contact info, and check freshness).
- `GET /business-context?project_id=...` if running this for a non-Distribb project, so competitor exclusions are respected.
- Skip any Distribb write/publish endpoints, this workflow does not create articles.

## Slash Commands

This skill ships a set of slash commands in its `commands/` folder so the user can drive the whole workflow with `/`. Each command is a thin entry point that loads this skill and the matching reference, then runs the workflow against `$ARGUMENTS`.

| Command | Argument | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `/distribb` | (none) | Overview, account status, and the proper SEO process |
| `/distribb-setup` | (none) | Validate the API key, confirm website + GSC are connected, register the other commands |
| `/gsc-audit` | `<domain>` | Full audit (`references/audit-playbook.md`) |
| `/keyword-research` | `<seed keyword>` | Keyword ideas with volume + difficulty |
| `/write-article` | `<keyword>` | Research, write, link, backlink, and publish one article |
| `/optimize` | (none) | GSC-driven rewrites of pages stuck on page 2+ |
| `/backlinks` | (none) | Credits, targets, and how the exchange works |
| `/content-calendar` | (none) | List / schedule / manage articles |
| `/ai-visibility` | (none) | AI-search visibility + listicle outreach research |
| `/news-writer` | `<site-url-or-niche>` | Newsjack: find fresh news, write grounded drafts, queue in Distribb |
| `/statistics-page-writer` | `<industry-or-topic>` | Deep-research and publish a journalist-ready statistics page |

**Enabling the commands.** Depending on how the skill was installed, the commands may already be live. If a command is not recognized, register them once by copying this skill's command files into the project's command folder:

```bash
# From the project root, with <skill_dir> = where this skill is installed
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp <skill_dir>/commands/*.md .claude/commands/
```

`/distribb-setup` does this automatically (it locates the skill directory and copies the files for you), then the commands are available after the next message. Power users can also work entirely through the API sections in this file without any slash commands.

---

## Sub-skills

This skill ships with structured sub-workflows for opinionated multi-week SEO programs. Load the matching sub-skill's `SKILL.md` instead of trying to run the workflow from this top-level file.

| Sub-skill folder | When to invoke |
|---|---|
| [`90-day-seo-sprint/`](./90-day-seo-sprint/SKILL.md) | User asks for an SEO sprint, a 90-day SEO plan, an SEO tracker / roadmap, "where do I start with SEO", "how do I get my first 1,000 organic visitors", or anything similar. Sub-skill opens the Distribb tracker Google Sheet in their browser and walks them through 4 phases (Pre-launch / Foundation / Content Engine / Authority) using the API endpoints below. |

If a sub-skill applies, **read its `SKILL.md` first** before calling any endpoint. Each sub-skill assumes you already have a Distribb API key set and the parent skill loaded for the actual API surface, sub-skills only add structure, content, and execution discipline.

## Error Handling

All error responses return JSON:

```json
{"error": "Description of what went wrong"}
```

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 400 | Bad request. Missing or invalid parameters. |
| 401 | Unauthorized. Invalid or missing API key. |
| 404 | Not found. Resource does not exist or does not belong to your account. |
| 429 | Rate limited. Too many requests -- wait and retry with exponential backoff (see below). |
| 500 | Server error. Something went wrong on our end. Retry once after 5 seconds. |
| 202 | Accepted but not fully completed. Only returned by `POST /articles/:id/publish` when CMS publishing was queued but not confirmed. The article status was set to `Planned` and will be retried automatically. |
| 503 | Service temporarily unavailable. External service (DataForSEO, CMS) is down. Retry after 30 seconds. |

### Handling 429 Rate Limits

When you get a 429, use exponential backoff:

```bash
# Wait 10 seconds, then retry. If still 429, wait 20s, then 40s.
sleep 10
```

Do NOT hammer the API in a loop. Space out requests by at least 2 seconds when making multiple sequential calls.

---

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| `GET /projects`, `GET /projects/:id`, `GET /articles`, `GET /articles/:id`, `GET /business-context`, `GET /integrations`, `GET /backlinks/status` | 30 req/min |
| `POST /keywords/search`, `POST /keywords/research` | 5 req/min |
| `GET /internal-links`, `GET /backlink-targets`, `GET /search-console` | 10 req/min |
| `GET /suggestions`, `GET /suggestions/:id`, `GET /suggestions/:id/diff` | 30 req/min |
| `POST /articles`, `PUT /articles/:id`, `DELETE /articles/:id`, `PUT /projects/:id`, `POST /projects`, `POST /projects/:id/wordpress` | 10 req/min |
| `POST /suggestions/:id/approve`, `POST /suggestions/:id/reject`, `POST /suggestions/:id/regenerate` | 10 req/min |
| `POST /articles/:id/publish`, `POST /suggestions/:id/publish`, `POST /projects/:id/onboarding` | 5 req/min |
| `POST /suggestions/run` | 3 req/min |

---

## Tips

- Always call `/business-context` first to understand the brand voice, competitors, and custom instructions.
- The `/internal-links` response tells you exactly how many links to include (`num_links_recommended`).
- Check `/backlinks/status` to see how many credits the project has. More credits = more backlinks received.
- NEVER skip `/backlink-targets` when `BecklinksNetworkParticipation` is `"Yes"`. This is the single most impactful SEO feature for the user. Articles without network backlinks do not earn credits.
- Scheduling: a `scheduled_date` promotes a `Draft` to `Planned` automatically; omit the date to keep it a `Draft` for review. Whether a scheduled article goes live or waits as a draft on its date is set by the project's `PublishingStatus` (`Publish Immediately` vs `Save as Drafts`/`Send as Drafts`), so always check that field before telling a user their article will publish.
- All API responses are JSON. Parse them with `jq` to extract IDs, URLs, and data for the next step.
- For long article HTML, write to a file first, then use `jq -n --arg content "$(cat article.html)"` to safely encode.
